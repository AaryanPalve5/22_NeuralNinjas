(Bright Minds or the Company) (NASDAQ: DRUG), a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, today announced that it is once again collaborating with\nFirefly Neuroscience, Inc.\n(Firefly) (NASDAQ: AIFF), an Artificial Intelligence (AI) company developing innovative solutions that improve brain health outcomes for patients with neurological and mental disorders, to provide a full analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) data in the Company\u2019s BREAKTHROUGH study, an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMB-101, a highly selective 5-HT\n2C\nreceptor agonist, in adult patients with classic Absence Epilepsy and Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE).\nBright Minds and Firefly have previously collaborated successfully to analyze the data of the Company\u2019s first-in-human Phase 1 study of BMB-101 using Firefly\u2019s advanced artificial intelligence, FDA-cleared BNA\u2122 technology platform.\nThe BREAKTHROUGH study is designed as a basket clinical trial that will include patients diagnosed with either Absence Epilepsy (with or without Eyelid Myoclonia) or DEE. This group of disorders consists of a range of rare epilepsy disorders, including Epilepsy with Eyelid Myoclonia (known as Jeavons Syndrome). These conditions are characterized by refractory seizures that are often resistant to current treatments. The BREAKTHROUGH study is targeting enrollment of 20 adult participants aged from 18 to 65 years old.\n\u201cAfter successful use of the BNA platform to analyze the data from our Phase 1 study, we look forward to once again collaborating with the Firefly team at the conclusion of our Phase 2 program for our lead compound, BMB-101, to provide valuable insights into the EEG recordings during the study,\u201d said Ian McDonald, Chief Executive Officer of Bright Minds Biosciences. \u201cWe believe BMB-101 has the potential to be a best-in-class 5-HT\n2C\nagonist. This compound is not only poised to make a significant impact in both the DEE and Absence Epilepsy communities, but also has broad applicability across the 30% of all epilepsy patients who experience drug resistance.\u201d\nAbout BMB-101\nBMB-101\nis a novel scaffold 5-HT\n2C\nGq-protein biased agonist developed using structure-based drug design. It was explicitly designed for chronic treatment of neurological disorders where tolerance and drug resistance are common issues. Biased agonism at the 5-HT\n2C\nreceptor is one of its key features and adds another layer of functional selectivity within a well-validated target. BMB-101 works exclusively via the Gq-protein signaling pathway and avoids beta-arrest in activation, which is crucial to minimize the risk of receptor desensitization and tolerance development. This provides a novel mechanism, anti-epileptic drug designed to provide sustained seizure relief in hard-to-treat patient populations. In preclinical studies, BMB-101 has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Dravet Syndrome and numerous models of generalized seizures.\nIn Phase 1 clinical studies, BMB-101 was given to 64 healthy volunteers in a Single Ascending Dose (SAD), Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and food-effects study. BMB-101 was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at all doses. No Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were observed, and Adverse Events (AEs) were mild in nature and in line with on-target effects for serotonergic drugs.\nAn extensive target-engagement study was conducted using both fluid biomarkers (transient prolactin release) and physical biomarkers (Quantitative Electroencephalogram, qEEG). Both methods confirmed robust central target engagement. A qEEG signature typical for anti-epileptic drugs was observed, with a selective depression of EEG power at frequencies observed during epileptic seizures. Furthermore, a potentiation of frontal gamma-power was observed in this study which could indicate the potential for improved cognition.\nAbout Bright Minds Biosciences\nBright Minds Biosciences is a biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Our pipeline includes novel compounds targeting key receptors in the brain to address conditions with high unmet medical need, including epilepsy, depression, and other CNS disorders. Bright Minds is focused on delivering breakthrough therapies that can transform patients\u2019 lives.\nBright Minds Biosciences has developed a unique platform of highly selective serotonergic agonists exhibiting selectivity at different serotonergic receptors.
