All it takes is some money, a little know-how, and time.\nWith that in mind, let's examine three simple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are worth holding for the long term.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nVanguard Growth ETF\nAt the top of my list is the\nVanguard Growth ETF\n(NYSEMKT: VUG)\n.\nVUG Total Return Level Chart\nWhat's great about this index-linked ETF is that it tracks many of the biggest and best stocks at a reasonable price. The fund\nis linked\nto an index that mirrors about 400 growth stocks, ranging from megacap giants like\nMicrosoft\nand\nNvidia\nto smaller names like\nEquinix\nand\nSynopsys\n.\nSymbol\nCompany Name\n% of Holdings\nAAPL\nApple\n12.06%\nMSFT\nMicrosoft\n11.42%\nNVDA\nNvidia\n10.00%\nGOOG/GOOGL\nAlphabet\n6.00%\nAMZN\nAmazon\n5.99%\nMETA\nMeta Platforms\n4.73%\nLLY\nEli Lilly\n2.87%\nTSLA\nTesla\n2.70%\nV\nVisa\n1.70%\nSource: Vanguard fund filings\nWhen it comes to fees, this fund gives cost-conscious investors plenty to smile about. The fund boasts a tiny 0.04%\nexpense ratio\n, meaning investors pay only $4 a year for every $10,000 invested in the fund.\nAs for risks and downsides, the fund has a few.\nFirst, this fund isn't\na great\nchoice for income-seeking investors. With a\ndividend yield\nof only 0.5%, the fund simply doesn't generate enough cash for investors who need\npassive income.\nSecond, since the fund\nis focused\non growth stocks, the fund will experience\ngreater\ndeclines during periods of volatility compared to most value-oriented funds.\nThat said,\nthe Vanguard Growth ETF remains a solid choice for growth-seeking investors with a medium to long-term time horizon.\nVanguard Value ETF\nNext up is the\nVanguard Value ETF\n(NYSEMKT: VTV)\n.\nVTV Total Return Level Chart\nFor those investors looking for a value fund, this is one I would recommend. Like its growth-oriented cousin, this fund tracks an index of 400 stocks -- but with a focus on\nvalue\n.\nTherefore, top holdings aren't Microsoft and Nvidia\n,\nbut\nrather\nBerkshire\nHathaway\nand\nExxonMobil\n.\nSymbol\nCompany Name\n% of Holdings\nBRK.B\nBerkshire Hathaway\n3.17%\nJPM\nJPMorgan Chase\n2.74%\nUNH\nUnitedHealth Group\n2.46%\nXOM\nExxonMobil\n2.38%\nPG\nProcter & Gamble\n1.86%\nHD\nHome Depot\n1.84%\nAVGO\nBroadcom\n1.71%\nSource: Vanguard fund filings\nThe fund boasts a tiny 0.05% expense ratio, meaning investors pay only $5 a year for every $10,000 invested in the fund.\nAgain, this fund has a few downsides.\nFirst, this fund isn't\na great\nchoice for income-seeking investors. With a\ndividend yield\nof only 1.5%, the fund simply doesn't generate enough cash for investors who need\npassive income.\nSecond, since the fund\nis focused\non value stocks, the fund will experience\nlesser\ngrowth during periods of positive market sentiment compared to most growth-oriented funds.\nThat said,\nthe Vanguard Value ETF remains a solid choice for value-seeking investors with a medium to long-term time horizon.\nVanguard Total Stock Market ETF\nLast but not least, we have the\nVanguard Total Stock Market ETF\n(NYSEMKT: VTI)\n.\nVTI Total Return Level Chart\nThis ETF is the most popular ETF\nin the world\n. It tracks the entire U.S. stock market, providing investors with broad exposure to the American stock market.\nSymbol\nCompany Name\n% of Holdings\nAAPL\nApple\n7.00%\nMSFT\nMicrosoft\n6.42%\nAMZN\nAmazon\n3.54%\nGOOG/GOOGL\nAlphabet\n3.36%\nNVDA\nNvidia\n2.99%\nTSLA\nTesla\n2.20%\nBRK.B\nBerkshire Hathaway\n2.16%\nJPM\nJPMorgan Chase\n1.77%\nUNH\nUnitedHealth Group\n1.67%\nXOM\nExxonMobil\n1.64%\nSource: Vanguard fund filings\nThe fund boasts a tiny 0.03% expense ratio, meaning investors pay only $3 a year for every $10,000 invested in the fund.\nAgain, this fund has a few downsides.\nFirst, this fund isn't\na great\nchoice for income-seeking investors. With a\ndividend yield\nof only 1.8%, the fund simply doesn't generate enough cash for investors who need\npassive income.\nSecond, since the fund\nis focused\non the entire market, the fund will experience\nmoderate\ngrowth during periods of positive market sentiment compared to most growth-oriented funds.\nThat said,\nthe Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF remains a solid choice for investors looking to invest in the entire U.S. stock market with a medium to long-term time horizon.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhen it comes to investing, there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\nIt's important to choose investments that align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\nIn my opinion, the three Vanguard ETFs discussed above are excellent options for investors of all levels. \n ## News/Articles/Posts:\n\n**3 Simple Vanguard ETFs to Buy With $1,000 and Hold for a Lifetime**\n\nThis is the title of the article/post.

And depending on your age, it could happen well before the average retirement age. This is the miracle of compounding.\nCompound interest\nis the magic that provides massive investment gains over time. For instance, consider an investor who puts $10,000 into an account and earns 10% annually. In the first year, he or she makes $1,000 in interest ($10,000 x 10%); in year two, $1,100 ($11,000 x 10%), and by year 10, the interest is over $2,350, and the original investment has grown to nearly $26,000, as shown below.\nSource: Author calculation.\nThe average annual salary in the U.S. is around $60,000. Here's how to become a millionaire by investing 1.5%, or $900, monthly in a tech-focused ETF.\nWhy invest in ETFs?\nExchange-traded funds, or ETFs\n, are excellent options for long-term investors because they contain dozens of different stocks managed by professionals, so you don't have to be an expert stock picker to make tremendous gains. We all wish we could consistently pick winners, but it is difficult. For every successful company, dozens fail. Take search engines.\nAlphabet\n's Google Search\n(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n(NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nis the big winner, so we don't think about those that failed, like Infoseek, Excite, Ask Jeeves, AltaVista, etc.\nThis is why a diverse ETF is advantageous; one company's poor performance won't sink the ship. Other advantages are that ETFs are easy to trade, just like stocks, and tend to have low expense ratios compared to mutual funds.\niShares Global Tech ETF\nTechnology already plays a gigantic role in society, and it is increasing constantly. Innovation is accelerating. I remember when answering machines and pagers were \"cutting edge,\" then the cellphone, home computer, the internet, global networks, the cloud, and now artificial intelligence (AI). According to RealClear Science, your mobile phone has 1 million times the memory of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Incredible. This is why tech stocks have been among the best-performing investments and will likely be so in the future. The\niShares Global Tech ETF\n(NYSEMKT: IXN)\noffers a terrific mix of the best tech stocks.\nThe iShar. \n This 1 Simple ETF Could Turn $900 a Month Into $1.2 Million\nwas originally published by The Motley Fool\nView Comments\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nRecommended Stories\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Yahoo.
