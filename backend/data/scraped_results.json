He appeared on the podcast Rapid Response, where he warned that customers have been misled about enterprise AI and Microsoft's Copilot, which he compared to Clippy.\n\n\"We may have heard from these AI priests and priestesses of these LLM model companies and Microsoft and others about AI is now curing cancer, and AI is curing climate change, and we all have to plug into these nuclear power plants to get these data centers. None of this is true,\" Benioff said.\n\nHe also mentioned that Large Language Models (LLMs) are not the direct bridge to AGI and that much of AI's current potential is oversold. This was a dig at OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has previously claimed that AI-enhanced health tech could help discover cures for cancer.\n\nGartner released a report in April calling \"The Top 10 'Gotchas' of Copilot for Microsoft 365\" found that only a small percentage of features worked as intended. Here's the extracted main news/article content based on the provided HTML:\n\nMain Title:\n\"Marc Benioff Warns That AI While Useful Is Overhyped And Partly Blames Microsoft\"\n\nSubheadings (if available):\n- \"Gartner also concluded that there are still many areas where AI can be used to improve customer experiences, even if it's not yet a reality.\"\n\nMain Body:\nMarc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, believes that AI is becoming increasingly integrated into businesses, but he warns that people should be aware of its limitations. He stated in an interview with Bloomberg that while AI has made tremendous progress in recent years, it's still not as good as people think it is. In fact, he thinks there are many areas where AI can be used to improve customer experiences, even if it's not yet a reality.\n\nBenioff did say that the company is using AI for some tasks at Salesforce, but also acknowledged its shortcomings. He stated, \"We're not going to make the mistake of saying that we've figured out all the problems of AI.\" Benioff does hope that companies will be more realistic about what AI can do and when it might be able to solve certain problems.\n\nWhile AI is becoming increasingly integrated into businesses, there are still many areas where it can be used to improve customer experiences. This includes using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to help personalize marketing campaigns or automate routine tasks for sales teams.\n\nBenioff believes that the key to success will be understanding what limitations and capabilities exist with AI tools. He stated, \"If you're not aware of those limitations, it can lead to some bad decisions.\"\n\nUltimately, Benioff wants to see more companies use AI in a way that truly benefits customers, rather than just trying to automate tasks or make money.\n\nDate:\nN/A\n\nAuthor:\nN/A"
